# Lung Cancer Prediction Using Medical History & CT Scan Analysis

## Overview
Lung cancer diagnosis is a critical medical challenge that requires a combination of clinical data analysis and imaging techniques. This project integrates two predictive models:
1. **Medical History-Based Prediction**: A machine learning model that evaluates patient history and lifestyle factors to assess the likelihood of lung cancer.
2. **CT Scan-Based Prediction**: A deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze CT scan images for potential cancerous patterns.

## Importance of Both Predictions
- **Medical history analysis** helps in early-stage risk assessment based on symptoms, lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption), and genetic predisposition.
- **CT scan analysis** provides a more definitive diagnosis by detecting visible abnormalities in lung images.
- While both approaches are valuable, **a unified dataset combining medical history and CT scans is not widely available**, limiting the direct application of stacked models for prediction.

## Stacking Model Limitations
- Stacking models typically improve accuracy by combining predictions from different models. However, **due to the lack of unified datasets**, stacking may not be directly applicable to merge CT scan-based models with medical history-based models.
- **Alternative Approach**: Medical history predictions can still be considered for an **aligned diagnosis** by supporting radiology-based findings. When combined, both models can enhance confidence in the diagnosis process, aiding medical professionals in decision-making.

## Conclusion
Despite dataset limitations, integrating these two approaches provides a more holistic assessment. While CNN-based models analyze visual patterns in lung images, medical history-based predictions add critical context to refine diagnostic accuracy. Future research should focus on developing standardized datasets that allow seamless model stacking for improved precision in lung cancer detection.
